# CODSoFT_Java_programming

Welcome to the CODSoFT_Java_programming project! This project is a Java programming exercise designed to help me learn and practice my Java programming skills. It includes three tasks that I worked on to improve my understanding of Java programming.
This Repository is dedicated to my Internship at CODSOFT
## Tasks

This project consists of the following three tasks:

### Task 1: Number Guessing Game

In this task, I created a Java program that generates a random number within a specified range and allows the user to guess the number. The program will provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low. Additional features include limiting the number of attempts and allowing multiple rounds.

### Task 2: Grade Calculator

Task 2 involves creating a Java program to calculate grades based on the average percentage achieved. Users can input marks obtained in each subject, and the program will calculate the total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grade.

### Task 3: ATM Simulation

Task 3 is an ATM simulation program. It allows users to perform various banking operations, including checking balances, depositing money, and withdrawing money. The program connects to a user's bank account and provides a user-friendly interface.
